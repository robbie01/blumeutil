      "Something must be wrong with Daniela-san. There was nothing wrong.\n",

      "[Mary]: 「Ahah, hah... You're right.」\n",
      "I decided to change the subject.\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Daniela-san, are you going to school today?」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Yes, I am. Professor Auguste asked if I would help him out.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Today? That's a lot of stuff.」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Yes, there is a lot today.」\n",
      "[Mary]: （Should I help out? Or...）\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Can I help carry your things?」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Really? Would you?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Of course.」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Thank you so much. I'll be so grateful.」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Okay, let's go.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Okay, Daniela-san.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Be careful. I'm going to go water the plants in the square.」\n",

      "[Daniela]: 「May God bless you, Mary.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「God bless you too, Daniela-san.」\n",

      "[Daniela]: 「Irina-san...」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Huh? Something wrong?」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「No, nothing. Mayor is very strict, so don't take any liberties.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Okay, I won't.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「...Phew. Finally here.」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Thank you, Mary. You helped me out more than you know.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「You're welcome. I'm glad I could help.」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Well, I have some preparations for class. I'll be off then.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Good luck.」\n",
      "[Mary]: （I didn't pay much attention when we were together, but... this room is filthy.）\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Well, I guess I should clean up now.」\n",
      "Pattapattapattapattap.\n",
      "[Mary]: 「I'll put these books on the shelf.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「What do I do with all this equipment? I can't just leave it lying around...」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Oh, good idea. Let's put it in the closet.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「And I'll sweep the floor.」\n",

      "[Mary]: （Phew, phew, phew...）\n",

      "[Mary]: （But I don't mind working. It feels good to have a clean room.）\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Huh? What's this?」\n",
      "There was something that looked like animal claws on top of her desk.\n",
      "Long and sharp. Long enough to fit in my palm, or maybe even longer.\n",
      "[Mary]: 「.........」\n",
      "[Mary]: （Auguste said he loves research, but why would he keep something like this hidden away?）\n",
      "[Mary]: （I can't just throw it away, so I'll put it back where I found it.）\n",
      "[Mary]: （That feels wrong...）\n",
      "Just looking at those claws made me feel extremely uncomfortable.\n",
      "[Mary]: （It's not fair to Auguste, but it'd be better if I just got rid of it.）\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Phew. This should take care of most of it.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Yeah, it looks nice and clean now.」\n",
      "[Mary]: （Auguste will be happy that his lessons will be easier now.）\n",
      "[Mary]: （I thought about heading straight back to church, but...）\n",
      "[Mary]: （Since I'm here anyway, I might as well watch Auguste's lesson.）\n",
      "[Mary]: 「I don't want to get in the way, so I'll stand outside and watch through the window.」\n",
      "[Mary]: （I wonder which classroom Auguste is teaching in...）\n",
      "[Auguste's Voice]: 「...Yes, that's right. Next question.」\n",
      "[Mary]: （Ah, Auguste's voice... That must be the classroom.）\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「This part will be on the next exam, so make sure to write it down.」\n",
      "[Mary]: （That's Auguste. He's come to the perfect spot.）\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「Look, over there. Concentrate and pay attention to your teacher.」\n",
      "[Mary]: （Huh? Me?!）\n",
      "It wasn't me. He was talking to one of the students.\n",
      "The girl apologized and looked at Auguste as she was told.\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「...Ah, don't stare at me like that. It makes my heart race.」\n",
      "Everyone in the classroom laughed at Auguste's joke.\n",
      "[Mary]: （Auguste's lessons are always like this.）\n",
      "[Mary]: （He does crack jokes every once in a while... so it's funny and easy to listen to. I don't want to miss anything.）\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「Now, let's move on to the next question.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Good job, Auguste-sensei.」\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「Mary... You're here?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Yes, I'm helping Daniela-san.」\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「I see. Well, you could have taken one of my classes instead.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「I am taking one.」\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「Huh?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「From outside the window.」\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「You were watching? How embarrassing.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Why? There's no difference between being inside the classroom and outside it.」\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「Well, yes, but it still feels like you're peeking at me from afar.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Huh?! I-I wouldn't do that!」\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「Haha, sorry.」\n",
      "[Mary]: （Did I really? Haha, hah.）\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「So, how did it go? My lesson, I mean.」\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「Any problems with understanding, or the students not focusing?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「No, none of that. You were amazing, Auguste.」\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「I see.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Yes. The children all seem to love you, too.」\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「How about you?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Huh?」\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「What about you, Mary?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Me?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「I love you, too, Auguste-sensei.」\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「Really? Thank you.」\n",
      "Auguste's mouth hangs open.\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「I'll work hard to meet your expectations.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Yes. Study hard and teach me lots of things.」\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「I take this very seriously.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Hehehe.」\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「Hahahahaha.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「It's been a while since we talked like this.」\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「Yeah, maybe. We haven't had a chance to talk privately for a while now.」\n",
      "[Auguste]: 「I hope we can keep enjoying these peaceful days.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Yes, me too.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Well then, I should get back to the church.」\n",
      "[Mary]: （...Right. I need to find Victor. He's probably around here somewhere...)\n",
      "[Mary]: 「...There he is.」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Whoa, Mary?!」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「What a coincidence to bump into you again today.」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Again? We haven't seen each other in ages.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Oh, you're right.」\n",
      "[Mary]: （I see... That's...）\n",
      "[Mary]: （I feel like yesterday happened again.）\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Yes, it has been a while.」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Are you okay? You look kind of flushed.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「That was just a misunderstanding. You're overreacting, Victor.」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Which misunderstanding?」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Well, whatever. I was hoping to see you again myself.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Really?! That makes me happy.」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Don't misunderstand me. I just want to ask you something.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「What is it?」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Ah, lately, your body seems to be acting strangely.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「My body?」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「N-No, it's fine. Just a little thing.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「You can't just say something and then stop. It's making me curious.」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「It's fine, don't worry about it.」\n",
      "Victor looks away.\n",
      "[Victor]: 「.........」\n",
      "[Mary]: （...Huh?）\n",
      "A sense of anxiety, worry, and frustration emanates from him. What happened to him?\n",
      "[Victor]: 「...Tch.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Is something wrong? Is there something you're worried about?」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「No, nothing... There's no reason.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「.........」\n",
      "Looks like he doesn't want to talk about it.\n",
      "[Mary]: （I knew it wouldn't be easy to talk to Victor. He's always so stubborn and difficult.）\n",
      "[Mary]: 「By the way, Victor. Are you eating enough?」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Enough? Ah, well... I guess.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「You need to get up early in the morning. You can't sleep all day. Also, you need to go to bed earlier at night.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Besides that, you're staying up late every night.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「You're keeping your room clean, changing your clothes...」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Stop picking on me, okay?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「I'm not picking on you. You live alone, so I'm worried about you.」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「I'm the one who should be worried about you.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Huh? Me?」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Yeah. Like, what if the church people are picking on you and you're having trouble with your training?」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Also, when will that...」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「That?」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Anyway, that's what I mean. If you're worried about me, then worry about yourself.」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Damn...」\n",
      "[Mary]: （Victor...）\n",
      "[Mary]: 「I'm fine.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「I love my work at the church. Everyone is so friendly and helpful.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「There's nothing troubling going on.」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「I see. That's good, then.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Thank you, Victor. For worrying about me.」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Y-Yeah.」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「I see. Nothing's happening... Thank goodness.」\n",
      "[Mary]: （Ah...）\n",
      "[Victor]: 「...Hm? Something wrong?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「No, nothing. I haven't seen you smile in a long time.」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Y-You noticed?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「You always seem so grumpy... Look at your face now.」\n",
      "I hold up my hand and lift my eyes.\n",
      "Seeing that, Victor blows out a breath.\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Pfft. Why would I make that face?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Oh, I know! Your face is scary, but that one is better than the other.」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Barbarian, I can't laugh all the time.」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「But...」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Thank you for the compliment.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Oh no, thank you. You've been giving me a lot of courage lately.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Well, I'd better get going. I'm getting thirsty.」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Ah.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「See you later...」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Right.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Huh?」\n",
      "[Victor]: 「Make sure you don't trip or fall down. You're clumsy.」\n",

      "[Mary]: （But this year...）\n",
      "[Mary]: （When my birthday comes...）\n",
      "No, not that. The problem isn't the birthday itself, but a little while before it.\n",

      "If that dream was a premonition...\n",
      "Both beautiful Dani and kind Virginia-sama would die, along with the others I held dear.\n",
      "No! I must avoid that at all costs!!\n",

      "[Virginia]: 「Is something wrong, Mary?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Ah...」\n",

      "[Virginia]: 「Are you okay, Mary?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「S-Sorry, Virginia-sama. I got a little distracted...」\n",
      "[Virginia]: 「Are you feeling ill? Let me ask Dani to get some medicine for you.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「N-No! I'm fine. I was just thinking.」\n",
      "[Virginia]: 「I see. That's fine, then.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Yes...」\n",
      "[Mary]: （Nothing will happen.）\n",
      "[Mary]: （That was just a dream. Yes, just a dream.）\n",
      "[Mary]: （...What could it be? It seems like things are getting rowdy outside.）\n",
      "I decided to go outside to see what was going on.\n",

      "[Mary]: 「Huh?」\n",
      "[???]: 「Hey, look! It's warm!」\n",
      "Outside the church, I found myself surrounded by several men.\n",
      "[Mary]: 「You are...」\n",
      "Everyone was a member of the village's self-defense group.\n",
      "They rarely came to the church, so we weren't close enough to call friends, but we did know each other.\n",
      "[???]: 「Were you hiding in the church?」\n",
      "The man who looked most annoyed was named Stefan.\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Hiding? I was just in my room...」\n",
      "[???]: 「That doesn't matter!」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「...!」\n",
      "Claus, another member of the self-defense group, shouted at me, making me flinch.\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Wh-What is it?」\n",
      "Each of them was holding a weapon. They were practically ready to fight a familiar.\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Where are Dani and the others from the church?」\n",
      "Anxiety spread rapidly.\n",
      "Something bad had happened to those people!\n",
      "[Mary]: （I think this has happened before...）\n",
      "[Klaus]: 「Come with us.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Wh-Why?」\n",
      "[Stefan]: 「Not just the people from the church... No, everyone in the village is in the square.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「What is going on?」\n",
      "[Klaus]: 「You'll find out when you get there.」\n",
      "[Stefan]: 「Stop dilly-dallying!」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Ow... S-Stop it! This is the church! You can't...」\n",
      "[Stefan]: 「It's fine! Hurry up! We don't have time for your whining!」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「.........」\n",
      "I gave up resisting. Even if I asked why, I doubted they'd answer.\n",
      "Even if I followed their orders, I knew these were people from the same village and wouldn't do anything too extreme.\n",
      "[Mary]: 「...Very well. I will come with you.」\n",
      "[Mary]: （This is happening again...)\n",
      "The square was packed with people.\n",
      "[Mary]: （I feel like I've seen this scene before...）\n",
      "[Mary]: （There are people over there...）\n",
      "As I pushed through the crowd...\n",
      "I saw a small creature with wings. Relm.\n",
      "[Relm]: 「Aah, you're here. I didn't expect you to come.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Yes, Relm-san.」\n",
      "[Relm]: 「Oh, you can call me Relm.」\n",
      "[Relm]: 「...Wait, hold on. How do you know my name?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Umm, well...」\n",
      "[Mary]: （...Why would she know that? I want to know more than her.）\n",
      "Suddenly, something popped into my head. He was called \"Relm.\"\n",

      "[Gerald]: 「...Hm?」\n",
      "Gerald-sama looked at me with an odd expression.\n",
      "[Gerald]: 「I see. That makes things easier.」\n",
      "He nodded as if he'd made up his mind, then turned toward the villagers.\n",
      "[Gerald]: 「My name is Gerald-Vilbervinnt. I rule the eastern part of the continent.」\n",
      "[Mary]: （Gerald-sama is a... a noble. A real...）\n",
      "[Gerald]: 「Is there a leader of the village?」\n",
      "[Jacob]: 「Yes, right here.」\n",
      "[Gerald]: 「On the day this girl turns sixteen, I will return to this place. You must give her to me.」\n",
      "[Gerald]: 「...As my bride.」\n",
      "[Mary]: （What?!）\n",
      "The villagers gasped.\n",
      "[Jacob]: 「Be quiet! This is in front of the ruler!」\n",
      "[Relm]: 「Now then, Mayor. I told you this would happen.」\n",
      "[Jacob]: 「Well, yes... but...」\n",
      "[Relm]: 「If you refuse, then...」\n",
      "[Jacob]: 「W-What will happen?」\n",
      "[Relm]: 「Dunno. It might not be all that scary.」\n",
      "[Jacob]: 「.........」\n",
      "[Relm]: 「Think about it carefully. Rash actions can cost lives.」\n",
      "[Relm]: 「Isn't that right, Gerald-sama?」\n",
      "[Gerald]: 「...Yes.」\n",
      "[Jacob]: 「.........」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Gerald-sama, why me...?」\n",
      "[Gerald]: 「You will understand when the time comes.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「.........」\n",
      "[Gerald]: 「I want you to remember this. I did not come here to cause you any more pain.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「.........」\n",
      "[Gerald]: 「You do not need to give me an answer right away. Take your time to think.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Yes, but... um...」\n",
      "[Gerald]: 「We're leaving now, Relm.」\n",
      "[Relm]: 「Yes, Gerald-sama.」\n",
      "Gerald-sama adjusted his black robe.\n",
      "Then, a sudden gust of wind blew, and the villagers closed their eyes.\n",
      "[Mary]: （...Ah?!）\n",
      "In the next moment, Gerald-sama and Relm were gone.\n",
      "[???]: 「...Mary? Can I talk to you for a second?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Daniella-san? Sure, go ahead.」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Um, Mary. I actually...」\n",
      "Something happened that I never expected.\n",
      "[Mary]: 「...A familiar?!」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「There's a familiar near the village?」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Yes. There are several that have been attacked...」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「...!」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Other strange things have happened too. The well went dry, and there was an explosion of a big rock.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「All of that...」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「But I think those animals just got angry.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「.........」\n",
      "A few animals were sacrificed every year. Whenever that happened, people would say familiars had appeared.\n",
      "But after looking into it, it turned out most of them were wild animals.\n",
      "[Mary]: （But this time... what about this time?）\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「I think most of the other incidents were accidents or misunderstandings. But this time...」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Someone mentioned a \"noble.\" That's probably why the villagers are getting restless... especially the self-defense force.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「The self-defense force...」\n",
      "Those were the people who brought me to the church that night.\n",
      "[Mary]: （Those people...）\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「The mayor is worried about what they might do.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「.........」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「So, Mary. Don't leave the church for a while longer.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Okay...」\n",
      "Today and the day after, I stayed in my room, feeling anxious...\n",
      "When I saw Daniela-san's serious expression, I understood what she meant by it.\n",
      "[Mary]: 「A familiar appeared, huh?」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Y-Yes, that's right. A few animals were taken away.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「So it's true.」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「True?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「No, um... I mean, the village was in an uproar. That's why I thought it might be true.」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Oh... I see. You had a bad feeling.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Yes...」\n",
      "Intuition. Premonitions. Dreams of the future.\n",
      "Things really were going from bad to worse, as I had dreamed.\n",
      "[Mary]: （What should I do?!）\n",
      "Should I tell someone about my dream?\n",
      "[Mary]: （But...）\n",
      "If I told someone, and they believed me, then what would happen?\n",
      "My dreams were real. If they were so accurate, could they change anything?\n",
      "I knew this would happen.\n",
      "That was all. My actions, whether in my dreams or reality, didn't cause anything to happen.\n",
      "My dreams didn't create familiars.\n",
      "And even if I had another dream, nothing would change...\n",
      "[Mary]: 「.........」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「...Come on, Mary.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Wh-What?」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「It's okay. Don't worry about it so much.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「...No, it's not. It really isn't.」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Huh?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「I had a dream. A dream that was almost exactly like what happened today.」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「A dream?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Yes. In my dream, the lord appeared...」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「And the self-defense force got angry and...」\n",
      "Everyone died.\n",
      "[Mary]: 「What should I do...?」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Don't worry. Calm down, Mary.」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「You're tired. You're thinking back on everything you've done today.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「N-No, that's not it! I'm telling you the truth...」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Yes, I know. I know.」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「The dream also featured a familiar, didn't it?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「Yes!」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「A two-legged wolf-like monster.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「...Huh?」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Didn't you know? The animal they took away looked like that.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「You're sure?」\n",
      "A two-legged wolf-like monster.\n",
      "I didn't know that. I hadn't seen that monster in my dreams.\n",
      "[Mary]: （What does that mean?）\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「...Well, you see, I told you this would happen. You're too tired. It's fine if you want to go rest.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「.........」\n",
      "Maybe that was it. Maybe I was just tired and my memories were getting jumbled.\n",
      "[Mary]: （No, I don't think so. Not when...）\n",
      "If I was just confused, I could understand. But if everything that happened over the past few days...\n",
      "[Mary]: 「But, Daniela-san...」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「Take some time off for now. Virginia-san is doing the same thing.」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「.........」\n",
      "[Daniela]: 「We can handle the rest later. Okay?」\n",
      "[Mary]: 「...Yes.」\n",
